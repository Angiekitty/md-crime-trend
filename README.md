Trends in Maryland Crime Rate
s the violent crimes rate in Maryland increasing, decreasing, or staying the same? In this Project, l wrangle the raw data supplied by the State of Maryland.  I also analyze the data using a hierarchical regression to examine both the statewide crime rate and crime rate for each Maryland county. Lastly, I plot the changes in crime rates for each county.


The practices use the crime statistics from the State of Maryland from 1975 to 2016. The Maryland Statistical Analysis Center provides this and updates data.
